# DataBall
A express.js server plus react.js front end for NBA player shot data visualization.

## How to run production
First you need to build your (or my version) of production files.
```
npm install
cd client
npm install
npm run build
```
The `<index.js>` file has already been setup to point to static build file.
```
cd ../
```
(so you go back to to root now)
```
npm start
```
Now hit http://localhost:3001/ and everything should be up and running!
